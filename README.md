# ThesisCode

This numerical code based on analytic expressions is part of my master thesis on the modeling of neutrino production in starburst-driven (ultra)-luminous infrared galaxies.
This code allows to compute the neutrino production in a nuclear starburst region of U/LIRGs upon input of 7 starburst-specific parameters.
